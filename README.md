# Shopify MultiBlock "One Page" Section

Shopify has some limitations on their homepage sections, where you are limited to only 25 section. Internal page sections are not movable, meaning you need to embed the section on the page. This single section uses common formats using blocks which you can move around!
No need to spend a monthly subscription for the simple stuff!

The CSS is not here but classes and block IDs are used. The blocks are customizable within reason.

Use with caution: placing this section on different pages will require you to create a new section.liquid to place on the page. If you want to use something more intricate, then I suggest using an app.
